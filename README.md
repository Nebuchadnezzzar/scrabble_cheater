# scrabble_cheater

Scrabble cheater is a command-line program that enables you to find all possible words from a given dictionary matching a requested pattern. 
 
The pattern is an incomplete word (string) in which the empty spaces are replaced by '.' or * '.' . tells the program to search for all words with the same letters as the pattern and a random letter in place of '.' . '*' doesn the same, but it makes the program to look for at least 2 letters. The number of '.' and '*' is not limited.
